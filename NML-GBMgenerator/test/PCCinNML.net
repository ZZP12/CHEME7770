// PCC network in Natural Modeling Language  Mar. 27

// 0th order generation & degradation
[] reacts (RNAp, eIF4E, Ribo60S, HSP, etc);

// self-regulation
AP1 upregulates the transcription of AP1;

// regulation: should say PROTEIN? or PROTEIN_act?
AP1_P_n upregulates the expression of CyclinD;

//one gene can have more than one form of mRNA
//e.g. there are two E2F sites in promoter, then the splicing is only valid for mRNA activated by E2F
? E2F upregulates the transcription of gene into (0.5*mRNA_XXXA and 0.5*mRNA_XXXB);

// unknown deactivation mechanism
? Rb deactivates E2F;
? AR downregulates the expression of g_PAcP;

// protein splices
CDC25 spliced into (A, B, &C)
//self phosphorylation
AR_DHT self-phosphorylated;

? use what type of default translation mechanism: eIF4E Ribo40S Ribo60S? all are unmeasurable.
? it seems better to write signaling explicitly.
? signaling is complicated... really not so easy to write in NML

//good example "reaction"
? enable modeling w/ unknown mechanisms, need tags for reaction products: naming system


//this is for # unusual chars test $ orz
//plz pick me out %
A, B, C bind;
abcbind;
a bound B to form C;
//confusing
abind, bbind activates cinhibit;
aactivates binds to ctransloates to form complexC;

a consecutive phosphorylation sequence a,bc, d;
a phosphorylated;
 a = b;
 a equals to b;
 a is __b;
 (a,bc,d) are (efg);

 a is TAGB
